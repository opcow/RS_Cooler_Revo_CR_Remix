This is a remix of the Red Squirrel Compact Fan Housing for Creality Ender 3 3D Printer by [Red Squirrel Hobbies](https://www.thingiverse.com/RedSquirrelHobbies/about). The Red Squirrel is my favorite cooling solution for the Ender 3.

### Changes From the Original

* This remix is based on my previous remix of the Red Squirrel Compact Fan Housing. That remix split the cooler into 2 parts to facilitate easier nozzle changes. This is no longer necessary using the Revo hotend and nozzle.

* Space was made for the larger coolign fins on the Revo CR. The "chimney" has been removed in favor of a simpler cable anchor point.

* The part cooling ducts have been made a bit rounder, and space was made for the Revo Core's strain relief to pass through to the right side of the cooler.

* More openings for airflow around the find have been added and the clamp piece was removed.

A generic base lock is included. This should be compatible with other Hero Me mounts.

Step files are included if you need to modify anything.
